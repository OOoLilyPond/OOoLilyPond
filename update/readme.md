## Receiving updates for OOoLilyPond

OOoLilyPond 0.5.0 (and later versions) will specify *ooolilypond-update.xml* in this directory as information source about newer versions.

ooolilypond-update.xml contains a download URL to the most recent *.oxt file. 

This will enable the extension manager of LibreOffice / OpenOffice to inform the user about new versions and perform the update process on request.
