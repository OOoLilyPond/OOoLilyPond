UPDATE March 2018: It seems that updating via the extension manager does NOT work at the moment. 
You can download the most recent version at 
https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/wiki/Downloads
and open it in LibreOffice / OpenOffice.

Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.8 since 0.5.7 (December 2018):

* Partial Spanish translation added (Thanks to Fernando Villagran!)
  To have the new language file "espanol.ini" available in the config dialog, 
  please launch OLy, open the config dialog and click the "Restore Language Files" button. 
  (Your current language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.
* Added option to have PNG graphics with transparent background (instead of opaque white background)
  (Issue 23) https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/issues/23
  If you are missing the French or German translation for that option, 
  click the "Restore Language Files" button (see above).
* Fixed an incompatibility with LibreOffice's new GraphicURL handling. 
  In LO 6.1.0  and 6.1.1 (for Draw/Impress: also 6.1.2, 6.1.3 and 6.1.4), the "Direct" option for "Insert Graphics" is broken. 
  For those affected LO versions the "Via Clipboard" option should be used. 
  The new OLy 0.5.8 release will work with all older and newer versions than those mentioned above, 
  so as of LO 6.1.5, the "Direct" option should work again. 
  (Issue 22) https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/issues/22
* The automatic toolbar creation during OLy installation has been reverted to the method used in OLy 0.5.6 and before. 
  It turned out that the method used in 0.5.7 only worked in newer OpenOffice versions (due to a changed behavior
  in the OpenOffice history), but is incompatible to LibreOffice. 
  (Issue 19) https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/issues/19
  (Maybe there will be a dedicated version for OpenOffice someday...)

Only for LibreOffice 6.1.3: Some dialog or message windows show "10" at the beginning of a line. This is due to a bug in LO 6.1.3 that has already been fixed for 6.1.4. 
So LO 6.1.3 is the only affected version.
