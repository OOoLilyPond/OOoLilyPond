It seems that updating via the extension manager does NOT work at the moment. 
You can download the most recent version at 
https://github.com/OOoLilyPond/OOoLilyPond/wiki/Downloads
and open it in LibreOffice / OpenOffice.

Changes to OOoLilyPond 1.1.0 since 1.0.1 (December 2020):
==========================================================

* New feature: Creating and re-editing OLy objects in spreadsheets (LibreOffice Calc)
* New feature: Batch processing for Calc, Impress, Draw documents
* Automatic toolbar creation ("OLy" button and "Batch" button) in Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw
* Option dialog modified: dedicated settings for Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw
* "Keep size & crop settings" now is a per-object setting.  
  In batch processing, it can be kept as-is or overwritten with "yes" or "no".

RESTRICTION:  
"Anchor to cell (resize with cell)" in Calc only is only recognized in LibreOffice as of Version 7 and some newer versions of LO 6.
Older versions don't have the "ResizeWithCell" property, here it results in "Anchor to cell" without resizing.  
The actual behavior depends on your LO version. 
It seems that some older versions always resized images (for OpenOffice, this is still the case with recent 4.1.8 version today), and that the new anchoring has been introduced to have an option to NOT resize.  
P.S.: If your image sizes have been messed up, you can use OLy's "Batch" function to re-compile all of them in one pass.  :-)

This release includes some changes to the language files. So, after updating to 1.1.0, please open the config dialog and click the "Restore language files" button. 
(Your current language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.)
