Changes to OOoLilyPond 1.1.7 since 1.1.5 (October 2022):
==========================================================

* Improvement: Support for cairo backend
    LilyPond 2.23.12 has a new option to use the cairo backend. 
    This allows to get SVG images without external conversion software and without dedicated svg templates (along with their restrictions). 
    It can be an easier alternative to the "pdf to svg" format. 
    OLy supports that if you choose the new "svg [cairo]" format option from the config dialog. 
    If installed for the first time, OLy will choose "svg [cairo]" as default format 
    instead of "png" if Ly 2.23.12 or later is detected.
    
* Improvement: Insert default "OLy" image if no LilyPond output available
    If LilyPond cannot produce an image due to severe errors in the snippet code, a default "OLy" image is inserted into the document. 
    (In prior versions, no image was inserted and the snippet code was lost when the OLy editor window was closed.)
    
    In some cases (pdf-to-svg format or svg [cairo] format and with the use of lilypond-book-preamble) LilyPond produces
    very small images (less than 1mm) that would be hard to discover in the document. 
    Now OLy even tries to recognize these and replace them by the default "OLy" image before inserting.

* small bug fixes

This release includes some changes to the language files. So, after updating to 1.1.7, please open the config dialog and click the "Restore language files" button. 
(Your current language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.)
