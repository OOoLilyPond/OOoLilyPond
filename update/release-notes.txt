UPDATE March 2018: It seems that updating via the extension manager does NOT work at the moment. 
You can download the most recent version at 
https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/wiki/Downloads
and open it in LibreOffice / OpenOffice.

Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.10 since 0.5.9 (May 2019):
=====================================================

* Fixed: In include statements, special characters (like e.g. German umlauts) are now handled correctly (Issue #27). 
  Thanks to Hannes E. Schäuble for finding, reporting and fixing this bug. 
* Fixed: If a file named "OOoLilyPond.ly" (OLy's temp file name) was present in an include path, it was 
  used instead of the one in the temp path. Now OLy will always explicitely specify the temp path before the file name.
