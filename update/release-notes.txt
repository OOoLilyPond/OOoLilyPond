Changes to OOoLilyPond 1.1.9 since 1.1.8 (December 2023):
=========================================================

* Improvement: Option to add missing "pt" unit to SVG files
    In some cases, SVG images produced by LilyPond (via Cairo library) are incorrectly scaled. 
    This happens if their height and width statement does not contain any unit. 
    For details see: 
    https://github.com/OOoLilyPond/OOoLilyPond/issues/10
    
    OLy now offers an option to pre-scan SVG files before importing 
    and add "pt" as unit if necessary. 
    To activate this feature, open the config dialogue and 
    activate the 'add missing "pt" unit' checkbox. 

This release includes some changes to the language files. So, after updating to 1.1.9, please open the config dialog and click the "Restore language files" button. 
(Your current language files will be backed up in a new folder. If you like, you can delete that backup folder.)
