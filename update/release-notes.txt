It seems that updating via the extension manager does NOT work at the moment. 
You can download the most recent version at

This release includes some changes to the templates and language files. So, after updating to 1.0.0, please open the config dialog and click the "Restore templates" and "Restore language files" buttons. 
(Your current templates and language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.)

Also it is recommended to choose the "Insert images: Direct" method. It will be more reliable, even with OpenOffice.
