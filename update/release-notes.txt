UPDATE March 2018: It seems that updating via the extension manager does NOT work at the moment. 
You can download the most recent version at 
https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/wiki/Downloads
and open it in LibreOffice / OpenOffice.

Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.12 since 0.5.11 (November 2019):
===========================================================

* Fixed: Include statement had been ignored if the containing Office document had never been saved to a file.
* Added template: Piano.ly (Only a [SVG] version existed so far)
* Fixed: All temporary image files are deleted after running OOoLilyPond.
* New feature: OLy now recognizes template files that are located in the folder of the containing Office document. 
    If no template with the right name is found there, OLy looks in the template folder (as before). 
    In Addition, if the template folder doesn't contain a matching file, OLy will search in its subfolder(s).
    (There you can store templates that you don't want to shop up in the Editor dialog.)
* New feature: When compilation errors are displayed in the Editor dialog, also count them and display an error number.
* New feature: Field names (Line Width, Staff Size, Custom 1, Costom 2) can be configured. F.ex. to replace 
    the "Custom 1" caption by "Transpose:", include the following line in your code: 
    % %{OOoLilyPondCustom1Label%}Transpose:%{OOoLilyPondEnd%}
    Older OLy versions simply ignore that.
