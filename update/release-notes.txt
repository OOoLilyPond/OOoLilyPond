It seems that updating via the extension manager does NOT work at the moment. 
You can download the most recent version at 
https://github.com/OOoLilyPond/OOoLilyPond/wiki/Downloads
and open it in LibreOffice / OpenOffice.

Changes to OOoLilyPond 1.0.1 since 1.0.0 (October 2020):
==========================================================

* New feature: Option to save temporary LY file into LO document folder
* Improvement (Linux only): When calling an external editor from within OLy, it is no more necessary to close the external editor prior to continue working in LibreOffice/OpenOffice.
* Minor bugfix: wrong helptext for "Import" button (English and Spanish version only)
* Updated templates: "School Demo" and "School Piano Demo" now allow font changes again
* Location for extension updates now points to new location at github.com/OOoLilyPond

This release includes some changes to templates and language files. So, after updating to 1.0.1, please open the config dialog and click the "Restore templates" and "Restore language files" buttons. 
(Your current templates and language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.)
