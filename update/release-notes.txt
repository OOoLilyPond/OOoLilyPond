UPDATE March 2018: It seems that updating via the extension manager does NOT work at the moment. 
You can download the most recent version at 
https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/wiki/Downloads
and open it in LibreOffice / OpenOffice.

Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.11 since 0.5.10 (November 2019):
===========================================================

* For Linux and Mac, now the configuration is read from the XDG-compliant config path 
  ~/.config/ooolilypond/config if such a file exists. 
  (You can manually move your config file there.)
  Otherwise the typical ~/.ooolilypond is used.
* Fixed: A placeholder for the path of the current LO document could accidentally be added to (and saved with) the Include statement. 
* Fixed: Error messages and warnings from LilyPond (through file OOoLilyPond.out) were not parsed correctly.
* Fixed: "Ignore Warnings" checkbox renamed to "Ignore messages from LilyPond" to reflect its true behaviour
* Fixed: LilyPond-created image could be inserted more than once in some cases:
  [creating new snippet (not editing existing one), OLy window stays open due to error in Ly code, 
   pressing LilyPond button several times]
* New feature: "pdf to svg" as graphic file format 
  (call external converter to convert LilyPond's pdf output to svg format)

The new "pdf to svg" option requires an additional conversion software to be installed. In OLy's config dialogue, a suitable command line must be specified. 
For Linux and Mac, it should be sufficient to install the "pdf2svg" package via any package manager. The default settings in the config dialogue should work without further changes. 
For Windows, a third-party conversion tool must be installed at your own risk. 
A detailed explanation can be found here in the OLy Wiki: https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/wiki/Config#pdf-to-svg

There have also been some changes to the language files. So, after updating to 0.5.11, please open the config dialog and click the "Restore Language Files" button. 
(Your current language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.
