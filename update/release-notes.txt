Changes to OOoLilyPond 1.1.8 since 1.1.7 (January 2023):
=========================================================

Small improvements, mainly useful for new users who install OLy for the first time:  

* In its Config dialogue, OLy now displays the LilyPond version for the specified executable. 
* Default graphic format is now svg [cairo].  
* "SVG" and "SVG [-dcrop]" templates are now located in a subfolder by default.  
  Thus they won't clutter up the template list, but OLy still finds them if they are used by a document. 
* Backup folders of templates and language files will now be created at the same location, not in a subfolder.

This release includes some changes to the language files. So, after updating to 1.1.8, please open the config dialog and click the "Restore language files" button. 
(Your current language files will be backed up in a new folder. If you like, you can delete that backup folder.)
