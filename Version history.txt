This release includes some changes to the templates and language files. So, after updating to 1.0.0, please open the config dialog and click the "Restore templates" and "Restore language files" buttons. 
(Your current templates and language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.)

Also it is recommended to choose the "Insert images: Direct" method. It will be more reliable, even with OpenOffice.



Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.12 since 0.5.11 (November 2019):
===========================================================

* Fixed: Include statement had been ignored if the containing Office document had never been saved to a file.
* Added template: Piano.ly (Only a [SVG] version existed so far)
* Fixed: All temporary image files are deleted after running OOoLilyPond.
* New feature: OLy now recognizes template files that are located in the folder of the containing Office document. 
    (This makes it easier to share your documents with other persons - sharing your templates might be required as well.)
    If no template with the right name is found there, OLy looks in the template folder (as before). 
    In addition, if the template folder doesn't contain a matching file, OLy will search in its subfolder(s).
    (There you can store templates that you don't want to be listed in the Editor dialog.)
* New feature: When compilation errors are displayed in the Editor dialog, also count them and display an error number.
* New feature: Field names (Line Width, Staff Size, Custom 1, Costom 2) can be configured. F.ex. to replace 
    the "Custom 1" caption by "Transpose:", include the following line in your code: 
    % %{OOoLilyPondCustom1Label%}Transpose:%{OOoLilyPondEnd%}
    This feature is fully backward compatible: Older OLy versions simply ignore that. 
* Built-in templates now use the new "Field names" feature.
    


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.11 since 0.5.10 (November 2019):
===========================================================

* For Linux and Mac, now the configuration is read from the XDG-compliant config path 
  ~/.config/ooolilypond/config if such a file exists. 
  (You can manually move your config file there.)
  Otherwise the typical ~/.ooolilypond is used.
* Fixed: A placeholder for the path of the current LO document could accidentally be added to (and saved with) the Include statement. 
* Fixed: Error messages and warnings from LilyPond (through file OOoLilyPond.out) were not parsed correctly.
* Fixed: "Ignore Warnings" checkbox renamed to "Ignore messages from LilyPond" to reflect its true behaviour
* Fixed: LilyPond-created image could be inserted more than once in some cases:
  [creating new snippet (not editing existing one), OLy window stays open due to error in Ly code, 
   pressing LilyPond button several times]
* New feature: "pdf to svg" as graphic file format 
  (call external converter to convert LilyPond's pdf output to svg format)

The new "pdf to svg" option requires an additional conversion software to be installed. In OLy's config dialogue, a suitable command line must be specified. 
For Linux and Mac, it should be sufficient to install the "pdf2svg" package via any package manager. The default settings in the config dialogue should work without further changes. 
For Windows, a third-party conversion tool must be installed at your on risk. 
A detailed explanation can be found here in the OLy Wiki: https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/wiki/Config#pdf-to-svg

There have also been some changes to the language files. So, after updating to 0.5.11, please open the config dialog and click the "Restore Language Files" button. 
(Your current language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.10 since 0.5.9 (May 2019):
=====================================================

* Fixed: In include statements, special characters (like e.g. German umlauts) are now handled correctly (Issue #27). 
  Thanks to Hannes E. Schäuble for finding, reporting and fixing this bug. 
* Fixed: If a file named "OOoLilyPond.ly" (OLy's temp file name) was present in an include path, it was 
  used instead of the one in the temp path. Now OLy will always explicitely specify the temp path before the file name.


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.9 since 0.5.8 (May 2019):
=====================================================

* OLy will now automatically search for include files in the folder where the current LibreOffice document is located. 
  In case there are files with the same name in different folders, OLy will first look in the current LO document's folder.
  Thus, include files from here will have priority over those from other folders that are specified in the include statement.

Thanks to Hannes E. Schäuble for this useful enhancement!


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.8 since 0.5.7 (December 2018):
==========================================================

* Partial Spanish translation added (Thanks to Fernando Villagran!)
  To have the new language file "espanol.ini" available in the config dialog, 
  please launch OLy, open the config dialog and click the "Restore Language Files" button. 
  (Your current language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.
* Added option to have PNG graphics with transparent background (instead of opaque white background)
  (Issue 23) https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/issues/23 
  If you are missing the French or German translation for that option, 
  click the "Restore Language Files" button (see above).
* Fixed an incompatibility with LibreOffice's new GraphicURL handling. 
  In LO 6.1.0  and 6.1.1 (for Draw/Impress: also 6.1.2, 6.1.3 and 6.1.4), the "Direct" option for "Insert Graphics" is broken. 
  For those affected LO versions the "Via Clipboard" option should be used. 
  The new OLy 0.5.8 release will work with all older and newer versions than those mentioned above, 
  so as of LO 6.1.5, the "Direct" option should work again. 
  (Issue 22) https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/issues/22
* The automatic toolbar creation during OLy installation has been reverted to the method used in OLy 0.5.6 and before. 
  It turned out that the method used in 0.5.7 only worked in newer OpenOffice versions (due to a changed behavior
  in the OpenOffice history), but is incompatible to LibreOffice. 
  (Issue 19) https://github.com/openlilylib/LO-ly/issues/19
  (There will be a dedicated version for OpenOffice...)

Only for LibreOffice 6.1.3: Some dialog or message windows show "10" at the beginning of a line. This is due to a bug in LO 6.1.3 that has already been fixed for 6.1.4. 
So LO 6.1.3 is the only affected version.


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.7 since 0.5.6:
==========================================

* When installing the extension in OpenOffice, the automatic creation of an OLy toolbar failed. This ist fixed now. 
  Thanks to the anonymous contributor who pointed out this solution in his comment on 
  https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/OOoLilyPond

  (Only tested with OpenOffice. Strangely enough, LibreOffice 6.0.2.1 won't let me delete existing toolbars.)


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.6 since 0.5.5:
==========================================

* French translation added (Thanks to Valentin Villenave!)
  To have the new language file "francais.ini" available in the config dialog, 
  please launch OLy, open the config dialog and click the "Restore Language Files" button. 
  (Your current language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.
* Bugfix: When no graphics file was created, LY compiler error messages were not shown in OLy Editor window.
* some minor spacing adjustments in dialogs
* documentation URLs inside the templates updated to recent stable LY versions
  To have the recent URLs in the comment section at the beginning of the templates, 
  you can hit the "Restore Templates" button in the config dialog 
  (Attention, this will move your current templates into a subfolder).
  Doing that will not be necessary if you already know where to find the documentation section on the LilyPond website.


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.5 since 0.5.4:
==========================================

* speed up language file loading
* highlight LY compiler messages in editor window


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.4 since 0.5.3:
==========================================

* [SVG] templates are prepared to support the new texgyre*.otf fonts


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.3 since 0.5.2:
==========================================

* for Windows users: better estimate for program files folder on 64bit systems
* backup folder names more readable
* some minor corrections


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.2 since 0.5.1:
==========================================

* fixed: runtime error if path for language files could not be found
* new: path for language files can be specified in config dialog
* for Linux users: new location for temporary files (now being .cache/ooolilypond/tmp instead of .ooolilypond-tmp - you can delete the latter if you want to get rid of it).

There have also been some minor changes to the language files. So, after updating to 0.5.2, please open the config dialog and click the "Restore Language Files" button. 
(Your current language files will be backed up in a subfolder. If you like, you can delete that subfolder.


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.1 since 0.5.0:
==========================================

* fixed: missing parentheses in source code caused runtime error in LibO 5.3.1.2
(Apparently, LibreOffice 5.3.1.2 has a more strict syntax checking whereas earlier versions silently ignored that.)


Changes to OOoLilyPond 0.5.0 since 0.4.0/0.4.1:
================================================

* fixed: Runtime error - Variable not defined: line 40 CurserPosition=1 
* additional include paths can be specified 
* added button to save the current code into temporary file and open it in external editor 
* added button to re-import code from temporary file back to editor window 
* added support for the use of SVG graphics format
* fixed: wrong size of vector graphics in Impress/Draw 
* size and crop settings of existing graphics can be preserved
* user now can choose between two different ways to import graphic into document 
* font name and font size for editor windows can be specified 
* user interface can be translated into other languages

Compatibility: OOoLilyPond (OLy) works with recent versions of LibreOffice (5.3.1.2) and OpenOffice (4.1.3). Older versions should work as well. It has even been tested with OpenOffice 2.4 without issues. 
Any content (LilyPond code, templates, OLy configuration files) created with/for OLy 0.4.x will work with OLy 0.5.x - and vice versa. (Fully compatible, forward and backward.)
Older snippets created with OLy 0.3.x will also work with 0.4.x and 0.5.x, but not (necessarily) vice versa.


1.) fixed: Runtime error - Variable not defined: line 40 CurserPosition=1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apparently, a small bug in OOoLilyPond prevented the correct error handling, if the expected graphics file (produced by LilyPond) could not be found. Instead, the macro stopped with the mentioned runtime error. This has now been fixed. 

Up to LilyPond 2.18, both an EPS file and a PNG file were present if LilyPond had been executed in PNG format. In LilyPond 2.19, this seems to have changed, only a PNG file is produced. 
Unfortunatly, OOoLilyPond always checked for the presence of an EPS file and stopped if there was none. 
This now has been changed as well: Whatever format is chosen (EPS, PNG or SVG), OOoLilyPond checks if the corresponding graphics file is present.


2.) Additional include paths can be specified 
----------------------------------------------

In the configuration dialog, there is a text field where you can specify statements for additional include paths. Its entire contents is literally passed to LilyPond as a parameter. 
It can simply be left empty, or it can contain one or multiple include path definitions (i.e. the -I parameter) as described here:
http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/usage/command_002dline-usage#basic-command-line-options-for-lilypond

for example:
  -I"C:/Users/JohnDoe/" -I"C:/Program Files (x86)/"
(Even in Windows, LilyPond expects the paths given with forward slashes instead of backward slashes. OOoLilyPond will adapt the path statements, if necessary.)


3.) Save the current code into temporary file / re-import code from temporary file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working in the small editor window can be somewhat cumbersome. 
However, it only contains the portion of the code between the %{OOoLilyPondCode%} and %{OOoLilyPondEnd%} tags. 
Copying its contents into an external editor like Frescobaldi is possible, but compiling will not always lead to sensible results, because everything else from the template (including other fields, e.g. staff size) is missing. 

The "Open as temp. file in Ext. Editor" will therefore merge the contents of the editor fields into the template code and save the result to a temporary file "OOoLilyPondTemp.ly", which is now fully compilable. 
This file will be opened in the editor specified in the config dialog.
Your changes must be saved to that file.

The "Import from temp. file" button will read "OOoLilyPondTemp.ly" and update the contents of the code field and the "LineWidth", "Staff Size", "Custom1" and "Custom2" fields in the editor window.
Important: Only those five fields are updated. Changes to other parts of the template will be ignored! 
(If necessary, you can create your own templates or modify existing ones.) 


4.) Support for EPS/PNG/SVG graphics format / image size / crop settings 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the config dialog, OOoLilyPond lets you choose whether to use EPS, PNG or SVG graphics format. 
However, there are some restrictions:


PNG should work fine with both office versions (OpenOffice, LibreOffice) on both platforms (Linux, Windows). But as PNG is a bitmap format, it does not look as good as EPS or SVG when printed on paper. 


EPS does *not* work with LibreOffice. (Maybe this can be fixed in LibreOffice versions later than 5.2.4.2 - who knows...) 
On Windows, you will see no graphic at all. On Linux, in you document a graphic will show up which, however, has the same quality drawbacks as a PNG graphic. 
EPS works fine with OpenOffice 4.1.3, even if the graphics are not visible in the OpenOffice window. If you "print" your document with a suitable pdf printer, e.g. FreePDF ( http://freepdfxp.de/index_en.html ), the resulting pdf output file will be correct. 


SVG will only work with LibreOffice and *not* with OpenOffice. 
For SVG use, some more things have to be considered: 

* Most OOoLilyPond templates use "lilypond-book-preamble.ly" which *only* works with EPS or PNG format, and *not* with SVG (in that case, no graphics output file is produced). 

* You can use the templates "SVG Default" and "SVG Direct to LilyPond" with SVG format. 
However, without lilypond-book-preamble.ly, there is no automatic cropping of the resulting image. 
Therefore, you must specify the "paper" size for your LilyPond snippet in advance. As line-width must be given anyway, only the paper height would have to be found by trial-and-error. So maybe this isn't as bad as is sounds... 
By the way: in LibreOffice, you can manually crop the image after inserting. 

* If you edit an existing snippet, you can now choose to keep its size and crop settings. The default behaviour for that can be adjusted in the config dialog (independent settings for Writer and Impress/Draw). 
(By some unknown magic, png graphics appear auto-cropped even without lilypond-book-preamble. Therefore, switching between different graphic formats can mess up the image size when keeping size&crop settings.)

* If LilyPond uses fonts that are not installed on your system, they won't show up correctly in the resulting SVG image. Therefore, the two SVG templates have some preparation to replace LilyPond's default fonts. 
When editing the templates, in the \paper block you will find some code with a "define fonts" statement. Remove the block comment sign (opening brace followed by a percent sign) and adjust the font name according to your needs.


By the way: Up to 0.4.2rc4, when importing vector graphics (EPS, SVG) into OpenOffice Draw or LibreOffice Draw, the image had only about 40% of its original size. This has been fixed now.


5.) Two different ways to import graphic into document 
-------------------------------------------------------

Up to Version 0.4.0, graphics were imported to the clipboard and then pasted into the document. In LibreOffice, this can cause problems, e.g. when inserting as SVG into Draw. 
For 0.4.1, the developer provided a new method for direct inserting without clipboard use. In OpenOffice it can happen that temporary graphic files are not released after use and therefore cannot be deleted. In LibreOffice it works fine. 
In 0.4.2 both methods are offered. The option dialog lets you define which method to use in Writer and which one for Draw/Impress.


6.) Translation into other languages
-------------------------------------

OOoLilyPond now supports language files that contain all the strings displayed in the user interface. Language files can be specified in the config window. 
Their use might cause a slight delay the moment the extension launches. If you choose no language file, there will be no delay either.
At the moment, only English and German are provided, but maybe some more will be available in the future. Of course, existing language files can be edited and saved with a new name. 


What if I get an error "There is no EPS/PNG/SVG output"?
---------------------------------------------------------

For further information about what has occured, you can read LilyPond's compiler messages by clicking the "Ly Output" button. 

* Do you have severe errors in your LilyPond code that prevented successful compiling?
You can also jump to the reported errors with the "arrow" buttons at the bottom left of the editor window.

* Did you try to produce SVG output, and your template uses "lilypond-book-preamble.ly" (see above)? The preamble prevents the creation of a SVG file.

* In SVG mode, if your "paper" size for the music snippet is too small, LilyPond will split up its output into multiple images named "OOoLilyPond-page-1.svg", "OOoLilyPond-page-2.svg" etc. Those are not recognized, hence the error message. 

You can also specify "page-count = 1" to prevent the creation of multiple images. But if your paper size is to small, there's no image at all. 
Check Ly output for messages like "tried to space systems on a bad number of pages" or "number of pages is out of bounds".
